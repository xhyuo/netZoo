Description: PANDA(Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation) is a		message-passing model to gene regulatory network reconstruction. It integrates 		multiple sources of biological data, including protein-protein interaction, gene 	expression, and sequence motif information, in order to reconstruct genome-wide, 	condition-specific regulatory networks.[(Glass et al. 2013)]
	CONDOR(COmplex Network Description Of Regulators)is a bipartite community 		structure analysis tool of biological networks, especially eQTL networks, 		including a method for scoring nodes based on their modularity contribution.		[(Platig et al. 2016)]
	This package integrates pypanda--the Python implementation of PANDA (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005033),and R implementation of CONDOR(https://github.com/jplatig/condor) into one workflow, especially it is capable to use pypanda in R 		environment.
